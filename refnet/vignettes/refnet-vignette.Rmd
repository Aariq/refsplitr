##1 Introduction

Bibliometric databases, such as SCOPUS and the Web of Science, are a rich source of data for quantifying scientific productivity and studying factors shaping the emergence, disemination, and impact of research (Sugimoto and Larivière 2018). In recent years the type and scope of questions that researchers could address with these databases has expanded tremendously (Forutnato et al. 2018), in part because of their broader coverage, greater accessibility, and advances in computational power. Neverthtless, the ability to do so continues to be hampered - especially as the size of datasets increases - by two major and persistent challenges:

- 1 - Name disambiguation. Correctly identifying the authors of a research product is fundamental to bibliometric research, as is the ability to correctly attribute to an author all of their scholarly output. However, this seemingly simple task can often be extremely complicated (reviewed in Smalheiser and Torvik 2009), even when using the nominally high-quality data extracted from bibliometric databases. The most obvious case is when different authors have identical names, which in some countries is quite common (Strotmann et al. 2009). However, confusion might also arise as a result of journal conventions for reporting author names; for instance, one could erroneously conclude that there are two authors when there is only one (e.g., "JC Smith" and "Jennifer C Smith") or vice versa (e.g., "Enrique Gonzalez" and "Emilio Gonzalez" both abbrevaited as "E Gonzales"). Although failure to disambiguate author names can seriously undermine the conclusions of analyses,  verifying author identity manually quickly becomes impractical as the number of authors in a dataset increases. 

- 2 - Parsing author addresses. The structure of author affiliations is complex and idosyncratic, and journals differ in the information they require authors to provide as well as the way in which they present it. For instance, researchers at academic institutions might be associated with a Center, Institute, College, Department, or Programs.  These affiliations might be presented in different ways (e.g., Dept. of Biology vs. Department of Biology vs. Departamento de Biologia); the same is true of the institutions themselvees (UC Davis vs. University of California-Davis) and even the countries in which they are based (USA vs. United States of America). Furthermore, the same institution can have researchers working in different - often geographically disparate locations. 
Finally, all of this (highly variable) data is pooled under a single code of the reference record. In concert, these factors make analyses for which author institution or affiliation is of particular interest -- including spatially explict ones -- especially challenging.     

`refnet` is an R package designed to help users address these challenges. It imports and organizes the output from [Web of Science](https://login.webofknowledge.com/error/Error?PathInfo=%2F&Error=IPError) and [SCOPUS](https://www.scopus.com/home.uri) searches, disambiguates author names and flags any needing additional scrutiny, and parses author addresses to extract and georeference the institution at which they are based. Authors can also use it to generate simple summary bibliometric statistics and map author locations and coauthorships. Finally, authors can export the data in tidy formats for more in-dpeth analyses with their own code or packages such as 'revtools' (Westgate 2018a,b) or 'bibliometrix' (Aria & Cuccurullo 2017). 


## Using RefNet

Refnet's tools are applied in four steps: (1) data import and tidying, (2) disambiguation of author names, (3) parsing author addresses to extract and georeference author institutions, and (4) data analysis and visualization (Fig 1).  Each of these steps is described below.

**Figure 1 - The Steps of _refnet_**

###Step 1 - Importing Search Results 

The `refnet` package can import a single Web of Science data file or import and combine multiple files saved in the same directory. The acceptable file formats are '.txt' and '.ciw'. For this step we will use the `read_references()` function, which has three arguments:  

- **data**: The directory location of the Web of Science file(s). If left blank it assumes the files are in the working directory. If in a different directory, the absolute file name or relative file paths can be used.  
- **dir**: This is TRUE when loading multiple files stored in a folder and FALSE when loading a single file.
- **filename_root**: This specifies the location in which the output - a csv file of processed references - is to be saved and the prefix used to name this file. If you do not want to write a file leave this field blank.

The output of `read_references()` is a file in which each line is a WOS record with its respective value for each WOS field tag. If the directory contained multiple WOS files, the files were merged and any duplictae records were removed. This resulting output file is used as a base for subsequent processing by `refnet`.

<img src="Reference.PNG" height="300" /> 

Examples: 

a) To import and process a single file located in a folder named "data" and save the output as a file named "Brazil" it in a folder named "output":

`read_references(data = './data/Brazil.txt', dir = F, filename_root = './output/Brazil')` 

b) To import and process multiple files located in a folder named "data" and save the output as "WOS" in a folder named "output":  

`read_references(data = './data', dir = T, filename_root = './output/WOS')`

c) To save to a location with a prefix, write the folder path followed by a '/' and then the prefix:  
`"./newpath/newprefix".`

This will save the file under the root directory as "/newpath/newprefix_references.csv". 


###Step 2 - Identifying and Disambiguating Author Names

The next step is to identify all unique authors in the dataset. This requires identifying any authors whose name appears to be represented in different ways on different publications (e.g., "JC Smith" and "Jennifer C Smith") as well as attempting to identify different authors with identical names. The function `read_authors()` helps users do this by assigning each author of each paper an ID number, comparing the names of authors and other information about them in the publication's record (e.g., ORCID ID, Thomson-Reuters Researcher ID) to group all of the different names used by a single author under one ID number, and generating a list of any names/name variants that have been putatively identified as a single author. This list can be reviewed by users and, if they wish, used to correct the Master List.

####2.1 Name Disambiguation
To assist users in disambiguating names, `read_authors()` uses the compilation of references created with  `read_references()`. The `read_authors()` function has two arguments:  

- **references**: This is an object created by `read_references()` from which author names for comparison will be extracted. Any previously generated output from `read_references()` that has been saved to an object can be used.
- **filename_root**: This specifies the prefix that will be used in the name of the output and the location to which the output will be saved. The syntax is the same as for `read_references()`. 

Example: eb_authors <- read_authors(eb_references, filename_root="./output/eb")

The output of `read_authors()` is two files: 1) a "master list"" with all putative unique authors and 2) a subset of this list called "authors" with all name variants putatively grouped as the same author.


####2.2 Verifying Name Disambiguation
Once `read_authors()` has generated the two output files, users have the option of manually verifying and correcting author names or accepting the result of RefNet's name disambiguation algorithm. To review the names that have been grouped as a unique author use the "------_authors.csv" file, which contains the following information: 

- **AuthorID/GroupID**: AuthorID is a unique identifier for each name in the database (i.e., every author of every paper; the initial assumption of RefNet's disambiguation algorithm is that all authors of all articles are different individiuals).    

- **AU**:	

- **AF**:	

- **groupID**: This indicates which names (i.e., AuthorID numbers) have been grouped together under a single groupID number because they are believed to be the same person.  

- **Match name**: The name under which the algorithm groups all of an author's putative name variants.   

- **Similarity**: The Jaro-Winkler similarity score when comparing ---- and --- (range = 1-100, with a score of 100 indicating an exact match). We do not perform this analysis on name that are identical or matches without similar last name, first name, middle combinations. [this needs a better explanation]

- **address**: the author's address in the WOS record for an article [which one? AU or AF?]

- **RI**: the author's Thomson-Reuters Researcher ID number in the WOS record for an article  (if they have one) [which one? AU or AF?]

- **OI**:	the author's ORCID ID number in the WOS record for an article  (if they have one) [which one? AU or AF?]

- **EM**:the author's email address in the WOS record for an article (if it lists one) [which one? AU or AF?]

The algorithm attempts to match similar authors and then assigns similar authors to the same groupID. It then saves all match names into a file appended with '_authors.csv'. This file is the one you want to hand check matches, because it does it this iteratively the **groupID will always be the smallest authorID** of the group.

<img src="AuthorMatch.PNG" height="300" /> 

The sheet is ordered by groupID and then authorID. Users can review the grouping of author names using the similarity score, author address, ORCID AND Researcher ID numbers, and ayuthor email address. They can also use the original record for the authors and articles to search for them online. 

To correct cases where authors that are **NOT** the same person were erroneously assigned the same groupID, simply replace the number in the **groupID** column with the value in the **authorID** column (be sure to use the value from the same row). 

To correct cases where names that should have been grouped as the same author were not, then replace the value in the **GroupID** column of each name to be grouped together with a single **AuthorID** number. We recommend using the lowest authorID number among the cohort of name variants being pooled. 

Once revision is completed, save this .csv file [with the same name?] in the same location as the original file. 

####2.3 Uploading and merging corrections   

To merge the corretions made to the author list into the Master List", use the `refine_authors()` function. It has four arguments:  
 
- **authors**: This is the corrected version of the "authors" object. Must be in an object  
- **master**: This is the unedited master file created with `read_authors()`. Must be in an object   
- **sim_score**: If you would like to set a threshold for the similarity score, where all scores below a threshold are assigned novel groupIDs, set the cut off here. By default this is turned off.  
- **filename_root**: The location and prefix of the output, using the same syntax as previous functions. 

Example: eb_authors <- refine_authors(eb_authors, eb_authors_master, filename_root="./output/eb")


###Step 3 Identifying and georeferencing author institutions 

Now that we've identified matching authors we will calculate the authors location including their latitudes and longitudes for later mapping. We will use the `address_lat_long()` function. It has 2 arguments:  

- data: This is the output created from refine_authors. Must be an object.  
- address_column: This is a quoted character identifying what the column name that the addresses are stored in.  

The output is a modified data.frame with new columns for the latitude and longitude as well as various pieces of the address the algorithm could correctly parse out.  

> **warning** in the current version has trouble differentiating between separte campuses with similar names (e.g. University of Florida Main Campus, vs University of Florida Sattellite Campus). Depending on the resolution of your analysis this may be problematic, and we are working to address it **warning**

To create an output of the entries that `refnet2` was unable to georeference set the **write_out_missing** argument to **TRUE**. Then the user can fill in any they are able to determine and the newly populated address entries can be brought back into R. 

```
addresses <- address_lat_long(data)

new_address <- read.csv("missing_addresses.csv", 
                          stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

masteraddresses <- rbind(addresses$not_missing_addresses,
                          new_address)
```

> **warning** This function parses out addresses from the web of science reference sheet and then attempts to calculate the latitude and longitude using the datascience toolkit or Google maps API. This means it needs to use the internet and may take a rather long time to process depending on the amount of addresses it has to calculate. **warning**  

###Step 4 - Data Visualization

Now that we've successfully imported, cleaned, disambiguated and georeferenced the data. We can begin plotting the data. There five kinds of plots you can make. They are in two categories **World plots** and **Net Plots**. World plots simply plot author locations on a world map. Net plots use network analysis to plot connections of co-authorship on papers. We'll go from simple to complex. It's important to note that the rendering of these plots may take time, particularly if the amount of individual authors is >1000, depending on your computers processing power. So give it time if you are using an older computer or attempting to map a large number of points

####World Plots (by country)
To make a colored plot of all authors country of residency we'll use the `plot_addresses_country()`. The function has one argument:  

- **data**: This is the output from addresses_lat_long. Must be an object.

<img src="WorldCountry.png" height="300" /> 

####World Plots (points)
To individual plot points of each authors location we'll use the `plot_addresses_points()`. The function has one argument:  

- **data**: This is the output from `addresses_lat_long()`. Must be an object.

<img src="WorldPoint.png" height="300" /> 

####Net Plots (base)
To plot a network diagram of co-author countries of origins and how they're connected we'll use the `net_plot_coauthor()` function. The function has one argument:  

- **data**: This is the output from `addresses_lat_long()`. Must be an object.

This function has two outputs, in the form of a list. $plot is the plot, $data is the dataframe that was used to the build the plot. listname$plot is not very customizable, which is why $data is provided, so the user can build their own plot to their specific needs. 

<img src="NetPlotBase.png" height="300" /> 


####Net Plots (Country)
To plot a network diagram of co-author countries of origins overlayed on a world map we'll use **net_plot_coauthor_country()** function. The function has one argument:  

- **data**: This is the output from `addresses_lat_long()`. Must be an object.  

The net plot analysis returns an object that allows the plotting of these complex connections. `$plot` will plot the output to your plotting console. `$data` is the dataframe that was used to the build the plot. `$plot` is not very customizable, which is why `$data` is provided, so the user can build their own plot to their specific needs. 

<img src="NetPlotCountry.png" height="300" /> 


####Net Plots (Addresses)
To plot a network diagram of co-author using their individual addresses overlayed on a world map we'll use `net_plot_coauthor_addresses()` function. The function has one argument:  

- **data**: This is the output from addresses_lat_long. Must be an object.

The net plot analysis returns an object that allows the plotting of these complex connections. `$plot` will plot the output to your plotting console.  `$data` is the dataframe that was used to the build the plot. `$plot` is not very customizable, which is why $data is provided, so the user can build their own plot to their specific needs. 

This function can create a large data set (100's of MB), and may takes several minutes, so be patient and take the size of resources into account when running.
